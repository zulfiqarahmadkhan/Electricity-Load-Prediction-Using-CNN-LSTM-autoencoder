Our training and testing dataset is in the dataset directory dataset/IHEPC.csv 
The weight file after training the model is saved in the model directory model/model.h5
The output result plot is saved in results/actual_predicted.png
The actual CNN-LSTM-AE model include in Training.py. For training the model run Training.py file from the main directory.
For testing purpose run Testing.py
